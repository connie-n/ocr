This pages allows you to extract text and list up items from the receipt image file. 
You can find the result with below sample image file and try to process with your own recipt files.


**Model Information:**

This demo uses the Donut model, a base-sized version fine-tuned on the CORD dataset, hosted on Huggingface(https://huggingface.co/jinhybr/OCR-Donut-CORD). 
Originally introduced in the paper "OCR-free Document Understanding Transformer" by Geewok et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15664), 
this model utilizes a unique architecture that combines a Swin Transformer vision encoder and a BART text decoder. 
The encoder processes an input image into a tensor of embeddings, and the decoder then generates text based on these embeddings.
