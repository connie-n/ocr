This pages allows you to generate captions for the uploaded images using the Paligemma model. 
You can upload an image, and the model will provide a descriptive caption for it. 


**Note on Image Uploads:**

This application utilizes the NVIDIA NIM API and is currently being used under a free tier. Due to this, there is a limitation on the size of the images that can be uploaded. Please ensure that the images you upload are below approximately 135KB in size for testing purposes.


**How to use:**
1. Click on the 'Browse files' button to upload an image.
2. Once the image is uploaded, the model will process it and generate a caption.
3. The generated caption will be displayed below the uploaded image.


Hope you enjoy using this application.
